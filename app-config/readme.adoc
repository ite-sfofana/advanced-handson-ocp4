# Injecting configuration Data in to application

### 1. Create new app
```
oc new-app --name myapp --as-deployment-config nodejs:12~https://github.com/ite-sfofana/openshift4-advanced-handson --context-dir=app-config
oc get pods
oc get route/jenkins -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
```

### 2. Open the url in a browser

```
open the route above in browser
```

### 3. Create a new configuration map resource called myappconf. Store a key called
APP_MSG with the value Test Message in this configuration map

```
oc create cm myappconf --from-literal="APP_MSG=TEST Message"
```

### 4. Create a new secret to store the contents of the myapp.sec file
We download the file from git.

```
curl 
oc create secret generic myappfilesec --from-file myapp.sec
oc get secret/myappfilesec -o json
```
## 5 Inject the configuration map and the secret into the application container.
### 5.1 Use the oc set env command to add the configuration map to the deployment configuration

```
oc set env dc/myapp --from configmap/myappconf
```
### 5.2 Use the oc set volume command to add the secret to the deployment configuration:

```
oc set volume dc/myapp --add -t secret -m /opt/app-root/secure --name myappsec-vol --secret-name myappfilesec
```

## 6 Verify that the application is redeployed and uses the data from the configuration map and the secret.
### 6.1 Wait until the application pod is ready and in a Running state. Get the name of the application pod using the oc get pods command
```
oc status
oc get pods
```

### 6.2 Use the oc rsh command to inspect the environment variables in the container

```
oc rsh myapp-xxxx env | grep APP_MSG
```
### 6.3 Verify that the configuration map and secret were injected into the container. Retest the application using the route URL

## 7. Change the information stored in the configuration map and retest the application.
### 7.1 Use the oc edit configmap command to change the value of the APP_MSG key:
```
oc edit cm/myappconf
```

### 7.2 Verify that the value in the APP_MSG key is updated:

```
oc describe cm/myappconf
```
### 7.3 Use the oc rollout latest command to trigger a new deployment. This ensures that the application picks up the changed values in the configuration map
```
oc rollout latest dc/myapp
oc get pods
```
### 7.4 Verify the values in browser
